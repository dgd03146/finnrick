## 🎨 Widget Implementation

### Main Widget Component
```tsx
<OptimizedEmbedWidget
  rating="A"              // A, B, C, D, E
  starRating={4.8}        // 1.0 - 5.0 with half-star precision
  totalReviews={127}      // Number of verified reviews
  vendor="Polaris Peptides"
  productId="product-123"
  size="compact"          // mini, compact, standard
  interactive={true}      // Enable click-through
/>
```

### Size Options
- **Mini** (180×40px): Product grids, inline placement
- **Compact** (300×120px): Sidebars, secondary areas  
- **Standard** (400×160px): Main content, product detail pages

### A-E Grade Colors

## 📊 Distribution Strategy

### Recommended Approach: Web Components-Based Script Embedding

My recommended approach for distributing the Finnrick rating widget is **Web Components-based script embedding**. This method effectively achieves the three core objectives outlined in the exercise requirements:

#### ✅ Easy Integration
Third-party site owners simply copy and paste a concise HTML snippet into their websites. This familiar approach allows anyone to easily add the widget without extensive technical knowledge.

```html
<!-- Simple integration -->
<script src="https://cdn.finnrick.com/widget.js"></script>
<div data-finnrick-widget="compact" data-product-id="YOUR_PRODUCT_ID"></div>
```

#### ✅ Up-to-Date Information
The widget can be designed to fetch current data when it loads, ensuring vendors always display the most recent ratings. For this exercise, the widget uses mock data but the architecture supports real data integration.

#### ✅ Faithful Brand Identity
Using Shadow DOM, all CSS and JavaScript within the widget are completely isolated from external website code. This ensures Finnrick's intended colors, fonts, and layouts remain consistent across any environment.

### Alternative Integration Options

#### NPM Package
```bash
npm install @finnrick/rating-widget
```

#### WooCommerce Plugin
```php
// WordPress plugin for automatic integration
add_action('woocommerce_single_product_summary', 'add_finnrick_widget', 25);
```
